Algorithmic Optimizations of Boston's Public Bus System
=======================

## Introduction and Motivation

Through various personal experiences as well as a plurality of opinion from the media and the general public, we know that Boston's public bus system is in dire need of improvement. Buses are frequently late, trips take a long time, and the system is generally unreliable and inefficient. We want to take steps to change that with this project by applying big-data techniques and algorithms to existing transit data (among other things) and developing approaches to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of Boston's bus system.

## Goals for the Project
We have outlined two optimizations we wish to pursue with our project:
* Optimize access to and coverage of public transportation by moving existing stops along routes
* Determine a stable bus schedule given information about traffic (Google Maps API/NextBus) and determine optimum bus allocation for maximum efficiency and performance on all of Boston's bus routes
  

  
## Optimization Algorithms  
  
1. **Bus station placement optimization**: The routes that run through metropolitan Boston distribute stops across the city according to a variety of considerations. Ideally stop placement would take into account geographic population density and reduce the distance and amount of time it takes for a person to reach the closest bus stop. We use the k-means clustering algorithm to generate means corresponding to residential properties in Boston, and use those means to derive new optimal bus stop locations along a route. To ensure that the means lie along the original bus route, we first project all residential areas within 0.5 km of a route to the closest point on the route. We then map these points into a one dimensional space so that the k-means will only move means along the route, then map the means back into two dimensional space to get the locations of the optimal bus stops.

2. **Bus allocation optimization**: The second most important consideration in optimizing bus routes is the number of buses each route should be allocated. Using MBTA bus location data with estimates of their average speed and deviation, the average completion time of a route per bus plus the deviation of that time can be derived. Two metrics used to measure the allocation is the latency of the route (on average how long it takes for a stop to be serviced) and the inefficiency of the allocation (the probability that two bus schedules will overlap each other at some point).  Assuming that the distribution of completion time is normally distributed, and that buses will be sent out at equal intervals to maximize coverage, the formula for optimization is below:  
  
![Allocation Score Formula](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tyronehou/course-2016-fal-proj/master/alaw_markbest_tyroneh/poster/optimalAllocationFormula.gif)

Total latency is simplified in that inter-stop distance is not calculated; rather, latency is the average interarrival time (completion time / k) multiplied by n, where n is the number of stops and k is the number of buses. Inefficiency can be measured by the total area of intersection of k normal distributions multiplied by the number of buses. Output in the collection OptimumAllocation stores the optimal number of buses for each route.


## Analysis of Optimizations

#### Stop Placement

We ran our algorithm on bus stops along Route 39: (Forest Hills Station - Back Bay Station via Huntington Ave.) The route provided us with a good distribution of residential points along the route, ensuring that the kmeans did not cluster points with too much bias. Our results showed that new stops moved along the route towards areas with more residential areas, which may indicate that the current stop placement is not optimal.

However, our algorithm did not take into account cases when the spread of residential areas near to a route was scarce. For example, many bus routes extending past the metropolitan Boston area had a very low distribution of residential points. This would bias our algorithm to shift most of the bus stops inwards, leaving the outer routes with no stops. Additionally, we want to minimize the amount of travel time for each rider, as well increase the connectivity of the bus system to other modes of public transit, e.g. the T and Hubway. Thus we would like to run our algorithm on weighted data points from commercial properties, T stop and Hubway station locations in Boston.

#### Bus Allocation

![Optimal Allocation Graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tyronehou/course-2016-fal-proj/master/alaw_markbest_tyroneh/poster/optimalAllocation.png)

The results we found from the optimization algorithm did consistently correlate with the results from actual allocations of each route; those routes that generally had more buses running on them due to length or importance were generally allocated more buses by our algorithm. This is most likely due to the fact that the importance, length and ridership of a route were captured by the number of stops on a route and the average and deviation of completion time per bus on that route. 

However, our algorithm also consistently under-allocates the number of buses per route across all routes. The total number of buses that the algorithm chose to allocate was 401, nearly half as many as the actual active number of buses running on MBTAâ€™s Boston routes (around 800). This suggests that our algorithm has shortfalls as a heuristic and should take into account more factors that we did not consider.

## Conclusions and Future Work

Though the datasets we produced as part of our analysis are interesting and generally seem to fit the characteristics of the bus system, there are certainly a few things that can be improved upon in future work, as mentioned in the analysis sections above. Expanding our datasets to include commercial data in addition to residential data would go a long way towards improving our stop placement analysis analysis to more accurately reflect how many people actually use the public bus system: to travel to and from work. Additionally, many routes expand beyond the scope of our current datasets, so including more data in general beyond the core neighborhoods of Boston, Cambridge, Brookline, and Somerville would also be a prudent next step. Finally, further study of the factors behind bus stop allocation is certainly warranted, given the noted discrepancy between our analysis and the actual allocations.

Looking forward, it's natural to ask how these optimizations could be applied in the real world. Unfortunately, there are some practical barriers that make the application of this study difficult--specifically, politics. This is much more of an issue for the stop placement optimization: the [politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY) and cost involved with moving one bus stop--let alone every single one in the city--is absurd. Though it would still be hard to apply the allocation optimization due to internal MBTA politics, it would be significantly easier given the small amount of change that would be needed to get it working. With this in mind, the best candidate for a project to expand this study into the future would be **a system or service that the MBTA could actually use in practice to allocate buses based on historical and real-time data with derivative algorithms from this study.** We hope to pursue this as a research project next semester.
